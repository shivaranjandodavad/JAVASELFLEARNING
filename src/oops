every line of code will be present inside class

OOPS
1 class
2 object
3.constructer
4e Inheritance

class is a custome datatype/it is template of an object
object : realworld entity//depicts real world scenario
object has states and behaviour
ex : car
properties:engine, transmisson,wheel
functionality:running, breaks
class : blueprint or template of an object

constructer:method having same name as the class name which has no return type

Inheritance Parent entity and child entity has a IS A relationship in between
inheriting the properties of parent class to subclass
using extends keyword we can inherit the parent class to subclass


private entites will not be inherited

super() it is used invoke the properties of supeclass constructer

overide:custom version of functionality overiding parent


inheritance types
1.single inheritance
classA---> classB
one class one child
class A parent class
class B child class
2.multiple inheritance
class A   class B
    |      |
    class C
inheriting the propeties of morethan one class
multiple inheritance is not allowed in java
reason : class A & class  B possiblity having same method name to safeguard ambiguity


3. multilevel inheritance
class A
    |
class B
    |
class C

4. Hierarchial inheritance
       _______class A_____
       |       |          |
   Class B Class C    Class D

parent classes having multiple child classes

Hybrid inheritance not allowed in java it again inhibit multiple inheritance
